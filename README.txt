Welcome to Kamil's 
Branching Repository
where we write haiku

I write a haiku.
for all the world to see it. 
give me more stanzas. 

I write more for you. 
more better literature
let me try again

I can add rhymes too.
Can I ever write enough? 
there is so much stuff.  

This is a haiku
Not all of them are the best
Refrigerator

a washing machine.
cooking in a new oven.
ancient microwave.

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

What am I doing 
I am wasting my time now
end my suffering
